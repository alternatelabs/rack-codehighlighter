Currently, almost everything what I write is rendered by Ruby on Rails
and Sinatra applications. To improve the readability of the text, I
want the code fragments to be colored. So extending Rails and Sinatra
frameworks with syntax highlighting is a must.

The problem is to how syntax highlighting features are hooked into
these frameworks.

Look at the current practice. To this end, analyze the top three tools
listed on *The Ruby Toolbox* in category
[Syntax Highlighting](http://ruby-toolbox.com/categories/syntax_highlighting.html).

[tm_syntax_highlighting](http://github.com/arya/tm_syntax_highlighting/) (plugin):

    code(some_ruby_code, :theme => "twilight", :lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => true)

[harsh](http://carboni.ca/projects/harsh/) (plugin):

    <% harsh :theme => :dawn do %>    |    <% harsh %Q{ some_ruby_code }, :theme => :dawn %>
      some_ruby_code                  |
    <% end %>                         |

[Redcloth with CodeRay](http://github.com/augustl/redcloth-with-coderay) (gem):

    <source:ruby> some_ruby_code </source>

In each piece of code inserted into html we must change:
`<` to `&lt;`. This is annoying thing.
